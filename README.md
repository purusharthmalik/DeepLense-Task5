# DeepLense-Task5
This repository contains code for the preliminary test for GSoC 2025 - DeepLense

The common task can be found in the jupyter notebook in the repository.

As for task 5, since we got an ROC AUC score of approximately 0.98-0.99 with our first network, it would take immense amount of research to improve upon that and I am short on time.

I would be grateful if you could consider me for the proposal.
